## SerenTra

When you wear this wristband, it creates the sensation that the environment is cooler — by targeting the brain’s thermal perception. Using a Peltier module, the device periodically applies cooling pulses to the inner wrist. These short thermal bursts delay the brain’s adaptation to temperature, allowing the user to continuously feel a refreshing coolness. As a result, even if the ambient temperature remains unchanged, the user perceives it as cooler.
